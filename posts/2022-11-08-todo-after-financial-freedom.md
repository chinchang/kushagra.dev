Lot of times you go somewhere and see someone doing something, you feel you want to do it, at least try it out. I have a similar list of things that I want to try out. You could say I should be doing these things even now if I like them...and I mostly do. But there are somethings that need more of your time and can't be done alongside a day job - the below mentioned things are those. Things that I did like to try for a month or so. Hence, I wan't to do them after I have gained financial freedom.

## Financial Freedom

There are many definitions out there for the term "Financial Freedom". So let me first clear what it means for me. For me financial freedom is when I don't have to work anymore for money. I'll have enough for my needs and wants.

## My TODO List

- **Cab Driver** - I want to be a cab driver for sometime. I like driving. I feel I like helping people reach their destination üòÖ I might also choose to be a cab driver in a tech-savvy place like Bangalore where I could converse with my passengers and discuss tech with them, may be solve a problem or two for them üòÑ
- **At a restaurant counter** - I want to be at the pay counter of McDonalds or something where I can take food orders, provide money change to customers and get them their food.
- **Weekly sessions to teach programming** - I want to sit with kids and tell them about my experiences around programming (whatever I can remember and write by then). Guide them on how to be a good programmer and a product builder.
- **Fast food joint** -  I want to open a fast food joint...probably just a small counter under a big umbrella with some seating. Something I can take places and serve food. I specifically want to serve sandwiches & burgers and some drinks alongside.
- **Do customer support** - I want to join a good company as a customer support representative for them. Customer support people are the people who interact with the customers the most and are make or break for any company. I have always fancied talking to customers and solving their problems. I already do some of it, but I want to do it full-time and really take it to the next level.
- **Play music in cafes** - Ever since I saw people do live performances in restaurants, I have wanted to do this! I want to play piano at restaurants...and if they give, have dinner there every time I play for them. üòÉ
- **Live portraits at fairs** - I like drawing. I want to draw live at fairs & children parties and entertain folks.
- **Wood workshop** - I want to get a formal training in wood working and then open my own workshop to build custom furnitures for my customers.

## Side Projects?

Just to be clear - I haven't mentioned "Side Projects" in my list above, doesn't mean it's not on my list. It's love for me, I don't think I can ever stop building products. I'll keep doing them, on my side, forever! ‚ô•Ô∏è
