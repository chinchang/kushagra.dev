I had been recording data from Alexa since [Hint.css](https://kushagra.dev/lab/hint/) went live just to track its popularity and reach. Nothing too complex, just maintained a JSON file and added new object in an array for each data point. I had been thinking if I could visualize this data, just for fun. Did try [d3.js](http://d3js.org/). Though its a really awesome library for data visualization and all, it surely has some learning curve before you can have something out of it.

Then today I thought, lets try [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) which had been on HN sometime back. And I must say, its so easy to get started with it and that is probably the reason I am writing this post for anyone who wants to do some chart work really really quick.

Here is what I did.

This is the sample of data I had which I wanted to visualize:

```js
[
  {
    date: "15-12-2012",
    rank: 1896594,
    "sites-linking": 50
  },
  {
    date: "17-12-2012",
    rank: 1895639,
    "sites-linking": 50
  },
  {
    date: "09-02-2013",
    rank: 413592,
    "sites-linking": 47
  },
  {
    date: "12-02-2013",
    rank: 327643,
    "sites-linking": 55
  },
  {
    date: "14-02-2013",
    rank: 313141,
    "sites-linking": 55
  },
  {
    date: "15-02-2013",
    rank: 292197,
    "sites-linking": 55
  },
  {
    date: "25-02-2013",
    rank: 242294,
    "sites-linking": 88
  },
  {
    date: "26-02-2013",
    rank: 234704,
    "sites-linking": 88
  },
  {
    date: "02-03-2013",
    rank: 213869,
    "sites-linking": 100
  }
];
```

First thing I did was clone the [github repo for Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js):

```bash
git clone git://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js.git
cd Chart.js
```

In the repo, you'll find a <code>samples/</code> folder which has some examples of using Chart.js. I needed a line chart, so I opened <code>samples/line.html</code> in Sublime and started reading the code. It was such little code which created a sweet little line graph with subtle animations.

This was the old JS there:

```js
var lineChartData = {
  labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
  datasets: [
    {
      fillColor: "rgba(220,220,220,0.5)",
      strokeColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
      pointColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
      pointStrokeColor: "#fff",
      data: [65, 59, 90, 81, 56, 55, 40]
    },
    {
      fillColor: "rgba(151,187,205,0.5)",
      strokeColor: "rgba(151,187,205,1)",
      pointColor: "rgba(151,187,205,1)",
      pointStrokeColor: "#fff",
      data: [28, 48, 40, 19, 96, 27, 100]
    }
  ]
};

var myLine = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas").getContext("2d")).Line(
  lineChartData
);
```

Next what I did was get my data into that script. So I simply made a variable and assigned my object to it. Also to begin with, I removed one of the data set entry from the array so I can visualize just the <code>rank</code> key:

```js
var myData = [
    {
      date: "15-12-2012",
      rank: 1896594,
      "sites-linking": 50
    },
    {
      date: "17-12-2012",
      rank: 1895639,
      "sites-linking": 50
    },
    {
      date: "09-02-2013",
      rank: 413592,
      "sites-linking": 47
    },
    {
      date: "12-02-2013",
      rank: 327643,
      "sites-linking": 55
    },
    {
      date: "14-02-2013",
      rank: 313141,
      "sites-linking": 55
    },
    {
      date: "15-02-2013",
      rank: 292197,
      "sites-linking": 55
    },
    {
      date: "25-02-2013",
      rank: 242294,
      "sites-linking": 88
    },
    {
      date: "26-02-2013",
      rank: 234704,
      "sites-linking": 88
    },
    {
      date: "02-03-2013",
      rank: 213869,
      "sites-linking": 100
    }
  ],
  lineChartData = {
    labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
    datasets: [
      {
        fillColor: "rgba(220,220,220,0.5)",
        strokeColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
        pointColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
        pointStrokeColor: "#fff",
        data: [65, 59, 90, 81, 56, 55, 40]
      }
    ]
  };
```

If you note in the above code where <code>lineChartData</code> is being created, values corresponding to the data we want to visualize are arrays. To be specific, its the <code>label</code> and <code>data</code> keys in that object. So we need to convert our data into arrays which could be assigned to those 2 keys.

For that I made a small function called <code>mapProperty</code> (inspired from Emberjs) which basically maps the array with only the passed property values.

```js
Array.prototype.mapProperty = function(property) {
  return this.map(function(obj) {
    return obj[property];
  });
};

// Example: myData.mapProperty('rank') to get an array of all ranks
```

Now all I had to do is use the above function to map my data on appropriate key and assign in the <code>lineChartData</code>:

```js
lineChartData = {
  labels: myData.mapProperty("date"),
  datasets: [
    {
      fillColor: "rgba(220,220,220,0.5)",
      strokeColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
      pointColor: "rgba(220,220,220,1)",
      pointStrokeColor: "#fff",
      data: myData.mapProperty("rank")
    }
  ]
};
```

I refreshed the page in browser and voila! My data was converted into a beautiful chart. Wasn't that dead simple?

<img src="/images/2013/rank-chart.png" alt="Alexa rank visualized" title="Alexa rank chart" />

I added another dataset entry for the <code>sites-linking</code>, but <code>rank</code> values being much larger than <code>sites-linking</code> key, it made the <code>sites-linking</code> line almost invisible.

To sum up,

**Good**: easy to use, fast, nice animations, multiple chart types

**Bad**: no tooltips, no interactivity

Its still a new library and has a long way to go. It has been receiving contributions from Open Source developers and I think it will evolve into a cool visualization library soon.

[Hack it here](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js).
