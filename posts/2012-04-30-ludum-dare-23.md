Hey everyone!

Last weekend was just super awesome...it was **[Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/)** 23 - The ultimate 48 hour compo. The theme was 'Tiny World' and I was in this time (my 2nd LD). I chose to make a game on flash platform using the **[Flashpunk](http://www.flashpunk.com)** game library. The game is called _SAVE ME_ in which you control a cute alien which is attacked by some evil species. You can jump on planets and even hop from one planet to another collecting the game power-ups.

Some points about this LD for me were:

- Gave more time and priority to gameplay.

- Drew quite a lot pixel art for the first time (it was fun).

- Tried some new game mechanics.

- Integrated almost all game elements (sounds really matter).

## **[Play and rate](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=4201)** my entry.

Now that the compo is over, I have played around 60 entries out which here are my best picks (in no order):

- **[Memento XII - deepnight](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=2982): **As always, this entry by deepnight has mind blowing graphics. The pixel art is really good and gives a very nice feel to the game. Though being a _point and click adventure_ type, I was not that a fan of the gameplay.

- **[Astro Break - hulahulahest](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=528)**: This was a really well made contra style game. I loved the sprites and the whole idea of having a shoot'emup on a lil planet was greet. A game to play for powerups!

- **[Soul Searchin' - MaximSchoemaker](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11306)**: A 100% into the the theme entry. A very well executed idea where the player can be shrunk and grown to clear levels inside levels...A nice level design too.

- **[Nook - PoV](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=19): **Another shrink/grow type jam entry which wonderful graphics and animation. The game is fun to play and effects are neat.

So go ahead, play them, rate them and be cool :)

Till next time, cya!
