Hey fellow developers!

It has been a long time since I wrote my last post. Well, I have got a reason for this one :)

Four days back, Nasscom organized its third **[Game Developers Conference](http://ngdc.nasscom.in/)** in Pune. What was different this time was the BYOG event conducted by the Indie Game Development India community. Yes, you heard that right a **[Build Your Own Game](http://ingd.in/byog/nasscom-2011)** wherein a game was to be developed in 48 hours...savvy!

Unfortunately, I could not attend the awesome event this year. Nevertheless, I took part in the BYOG remotely. And what I came up with in this jam was **[Fun With Force](http://ingd.in/project/fun-forces)**. The theme of my game was 'physics'. Its a very simple prototype but I'm happy with the result. And yes...it won the 3rd prize in the jam :D

Let the developer (me) know your comments and suggestions.

More updates on my games coming soon.
**Cheers!**
