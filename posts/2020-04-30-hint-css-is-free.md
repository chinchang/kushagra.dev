## TL;DR

[**Hint.css**][hint-css] is FREE again after being a paid product for nearly 3.5 years! 🥳

## Back Story

[Hint.css][hint-css] is a CSS library I built back in 2013. It is a CSS-only solution to create tooltips. After it launched, it quickly gained a lot of traction, thousands of [stars on Github][gh], was featured twice (🥶) on the [homepage of][hn1] [HackerNews][hn2], [featured on ProductHunt][ph] and mentioned on countless websites. It was launched under the MIT license and was free to use, no matter how you used it.

In 2016 I decided to monetize it. I came across a resource aggregation website called Uplabs which had also started its own marketplace. It was still free for personal projects. But if you did use it in a commercial project, a license had to be purchased. I decided to monetize it for a number of reasons:

- It was a very popular tooltip library
- I had never monetized any of my product before. I wanted to try it out.
- Who doesn't want a few bucks from a side-project! 😬

## And Today

After a period of 3.5 years, I have finally decided to make it free again! Here is why I have made this decision:

- It has not been getting too many sales recently. There is a life of every product on a marketplace.
- I think it has earned me enough, considering it was a few hours project! (and some days of maintenance) 😃

## The Fun Part

Okay, now the interesting part. How much did it earn me!! I have experimented a lot over the years with its pricing. I don't have an exact count of the number of sales (Uplabs doesn't give that). But till date, Hint.css has made **\$1902.88** in sales! I think it is pretty good considering the library is just a few lines of CSS I wrote. 😎

## Few Learnings

- Experiment with pricing. It's difficult to guess what something is worth. I didn't expect people to purchased Hint.css for as much as \$70!
- Side projects can teach you a lot of things. Hint.css taught me open-source maintenance and product monetization.

I am really proud of this sweet little experiment of mine. 🤩 And now that Hint.css is free again, go and use it to add some quick tooltips to your websites. Ciao!
