Another year passed and its review time :) But this time instead of reviewing the year month wise, I'll do it in few categories.

## Tech

This has to be the first category for review as this is what I love to do the most.

<figure>
	<h3>Perfaudit</h3>
	<img src="/images/2015/perfaudit.png" alt="">
	<figcaption><a href="https://perfaudit.com">PerfAudit</a> was this year's first side project that I did with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/Apoorv_Saxena">Apoorv</a>. We did case-studies for some awesome websites, helped people make their sites faster and got lot of appreciation. It was fun.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<h3>cta.js</h3>
	<img src="/images/2015/ctajs.png" alt="">
	<figcaption><a href="http://kushagragour.in/lab/ctajs/">Cta.js</a> is a JS library I wrote inspired from <a href="https://twitter.com/aerotwist">Paul Lewis'</a> technique to performantly transition DOM elements.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<h3>konsole.table, super-search & screenlog.js</h3>
	<figcaption>
	3 more JS shorties I did. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/konsole.table">konsole.table</a> was my first npm module which provides `console.table` in node environment. And <a href="https://github.com/chinchang/super-search"
	>super-search</a> is a JS library to enable search feature in any blog/website having an RSS feed.
	<br>
	<a href="https://github.com/chinchang/screenlog.js">screenlog.js</a> makes it possible to use `console` statements without opening the console in your browser.
	</figcaption>

	<h3>Prototyp</h3>
	<img src="/images/2015/prototyp.png" alt="">
	<figcaption>Then I did one of my most "useful" app of the year :P I had started playing with Framer.js and was really impressed with what one can do with it very easily. But the editor for it is paid and just available for mac. So I decided to build a web app over Framer.js which is free and works across platforms.
	<br>
	I would say this is by far the closest I have come to creating a product :) Hope to make it more usable in coming time

	<a href="https://kushagra.dev/lab/kalu/">Kalu</a> was a calculator concept I implemented using codemirror editor. It aims at making long inter-linked calculation easy.

Heres a summary of it but checkout all of them on my <a href="http://draw.kushagragour.in/tagged/inktober">art blog</a>.

### Focusing on DX along with UX

This year I shifted my partial focus from User experience (UX) to Developer experience (DX, self-invented term). DX means I work towards making life of developers easy in every aspect, whether its writing code or releasing it. That involves things like automating stuff and is a refreshing change for me.

### BSP

We organized our first Bug squashing party at office. Quite a success I would say.

### New office

Our product team at Wingify moved to a new office. New environment, new vibes, less distraction.

### Hackathon

I made an app called [**Gamjeong**](http://chennainerd.2015.nodeknockout.com/) along with [Dheeraj](https://twitter.com/dheerajhere) at a hackathon we had at Wingify. It send you push notifications for tweets that match the keyword and sentiment you say.

## Misc

<figure>
	<h3>Rubiks Cube</h3>
	<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVr-DeIR7TY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<figcaption>
		Beginning this year, I started solving rubiks cube. Apart from getting down from 5 minutes/solve to 50 seconds/solve, best thing was perseverance. I kept practicing it the whole year...probably because its too handly and I keep playing with it in buses, trains, boring weddings and where not :)

### Summary

I created a lot of open source stuff, travelled a lot (by my standards). As far as art and music is concerned, I wanted to do more.

### For 2016 (in no order)

- Create and release more amazing stuff, as usual. More on product side instead of small libraries.
- Draw more often
- Release some music pieces
- Start a tech podcast
- Travel to more places
- Work towards making someone's life better
- Help bro with [Prakriti](https://prakriti.care)
