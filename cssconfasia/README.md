CSSConf.Asia 2014 talk
===

This contains my slides for CSSConf.Asia 2014 and the MMOCTG (massively multiplayer online CSS throwing game) game code I made for the talk.

### Running the slides

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `http-server -o` to open the slides in the browser.
- While viewing the slides, press 'g' to open the game.
- In the game to change levels, simply type `l{X}` to load level X. Eg. `l1` to load level 1.
- More commands in game: `clear`, `reset`, `win`.
